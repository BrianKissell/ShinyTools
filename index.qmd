Will this work, if I write something here?

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput(
    "id_type_of_study", 
    "What is the study type?",  
    c("Immersion Study with Qualitative Interview",
      "Survey",
      "Direct Mail Studies with Qualitative Interviews",
      "Image Evaluation Study"
      )
    )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)


```
